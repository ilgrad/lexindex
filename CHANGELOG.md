## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-28

First public release — compact, immutable string<->id indexes for huge catalogs; the indexing
companion to `betula-cluster`.

### Added

- **`StringIndex`** — ordered, FST-backed index: exact `string <-> id`, plus prefix, range, fuzzy
  (bounded Levenshtein edit distance), and subsequence iteration — all automaton-driven over the FST,
  never a full scan. Serialises to a flat, relocatable blob (`save` / `load` / `to_bytes` /
  `from_bytes`) with fully length- and offset-validated parsing (safe on untrusted input).
- **`PerfectHashIndex`** — minimal-perfect-hash dictionary (`ptr_hash`): verified-membership `id`,
  a faster `id_unchecked` for closed vocabularies (~1.25× faster than `std::HashMap` on point lookup),
  reverse lookup, and persistence (`save` / `load`) via `epserde`, keyed on a version-stable hash
  (FNV-1a + splitmix64) so a serialised MPH reloads and queries identically on any build.
- **Python bindings** (PyO3 abi3 extension, CPython 3.11+): `pip install betula-index`, zero runtime
  dependencies, typed (`py.typed` + stubs).
- **Feature gating** — `mph` (default) provides `PerfectHashIndex` (pulls `ptr_hash` + `epserde`);
  `--no-default-features` is an `fst`-only build, free of the informational RustSec advisories on the
  `ptr_hash` dependency tree. `fst`'s `levenshtein` is always on for fuzzy search.
- **Benchmark** — `cargo run --release --example bench` compares both indexes against
  `std::HashMap` / `BTreeMap` (build time, lookup latency, serialised size).
